# Progressive Image Loader for Silverstripe

## Archiving soon

> ðŸª¦ As all evergreen browsers now support the loading="lazy" attribute, no further feature updates will be made to this module.
>
> We recommend uninstalling this module and replacing any progessive image variables with the standard Silverstripe equivalent in your project templates.

## Features

This module does progressive image loading using IntersectionObserver (v1).

[Browser support for IntersectionObserver](https://caniuse.com/#search=intersectionobserver) (currently all the important ones).

While the module does add `loading="lazy"` to img tags, this module provides a polyfill for browsers that [don't yet support image lazy loading natively](https://caniuse.com/?search=loading%3Dlazy) (tl;dr Safari).

## Installation

The only supported method of installing this module is via composer

```shell
composer require nswdpc/silverstripe-progressive-image
```

## Usage

Call the thumbnail rendering methods directly within your template:

```ss
<% with $Image %>
$ProgressiveFill(420,280,90)
<% end_with %>
```

In place of
```ss
<% with $Image %>
$Fill(420,280)
<% end_with %>
```

## Requirements

When one of the `$Progressive*` methods is called, Requirements will automatically be added via the Requirements API, these are loaded via data: uris with SRI hashes supplied

### Templates

```
NSWDPC
  ProgressiveImage
    ProgressiveImage.ss -> template containing HTML loading the image
    Script.ss -> provides the JS to handle image replacement
    Style.ss -> provides CSS to assist with image replacement
```

## How it works

A thumbnail with 10% of the width/height of the requested size and a quality of 1 will be created. This will be the main image to load.

The final image will be created using the requested size and quality (420x280 @ 80% quality in the ProgressiveFill example above)

When the page loads, the tiny, low quality image will display by default, once the image scrolls or appears in the viewport, the larger image will load, thanks to IntersectionObserver.
